# Seizure-detetction

These two ipython-notebook file are part of the seizure detection project.
The seizure detection project is the sencond and the core part of the paper Automatic Electrophysiological Noise Reduction and Epileptic Seizure Detection for Stereoelectroencephalography, which will be submitted
in IEEE BIBM 2020 conference.

The helper ipython-notebook file is to help us to split long edf file into shorter clips, which are more friendly to calculating.
The Seizure-detection ipython-notebook file is to implement both seizure detection and visualization part.
