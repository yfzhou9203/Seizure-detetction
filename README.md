# Seizure-detetction

This document is the supporting material for the paper in the 2020 IEEE BIBM (coming soon) and 2020 SCASB (https://www.unthsc.edu/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/LinLi-2020-South-Central-ASB-Meeting-Abstract.pdf).

This open-source algorithm is aimed for efficiently detecting the electrophysiological seizures specifically designed for Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG).

To run the demo code (SZD.ipynb), following environment and toolboxes are needed:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scipy
MNE

The helper.ipynb is to split edf file into shorter clips for a faster process. The figures related to the paper is in wiki section.
